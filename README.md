# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build something in Swift.

# Requirements

* Swift 5.9.1

# Evaluation

The good:

* Simple language that looks a bit like Dart.
* Fast compiler.
* Correct way of handling text encoding.

The bad:

* Stuff I found on StackOverflow are constantly different as the language changes a lot!
* String class can be initialized with a URL and it will download the content; feels like a GOD class
* Swift feels like a pre-compiler; Examples contains compiler directives. Modern languages should not resort to compiler directives.

The ugly:

* This version of swift just introduced the '@main' but I could not get it to work as documented
* Simple 'trim()' function on String does not exist; different solutions for different versions and did not work at all
* Tar file for Linux
* Package manager is code plus it gets the code and compiles it
